I was enjoying the modelh (made my John Hawthorne, see modelh.club) but I wanted to re-map some of my keys. 
Sadly, there was no up to date (or complete) firmware anywhere to be found for 
the modelh. I used the matrix definition in modelh.h from:
https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/ae06ce0190f1a7af2fa2e180b7c0a383755ef2af#diff-461c144ec192f1b0abf75c780109b8e1f425a1c98467683185940291d6bce194

Here's hoping it works!
